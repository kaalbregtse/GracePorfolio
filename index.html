        <img src="./grace.png" />
        <p>My name is Grace Mcauliffe, I am 22 years old and I work as a swim instructor and an advisor
             in a before and after school program through the YMCA. </p>
        <p>Before, my current roles, I worked for Americor, traveling around the country working on 
            projects to help the communities around America. From my hometown in Indiana to the streets 
            of Denver, everywhere I go, I want to help people. That is what I am doing 
            here today.</p>
        <p>Currently, I am only offering sign ups for my swim instructions. More services will be 
            available soon.</p>
        <p></p>
